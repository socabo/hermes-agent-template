# Which hermes-agent revision to install. Accepts any git ref the upstream
# repo publishes — a release tag (recommended for reproducibility) or a
# branch name (`main`) for bleeding edge.
#
# To bump: check https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases for the
# newest tag (format `vYYYY.M.D`, e.g. `v2026.4.23`) and update the default
# below. Use `main` only if you accept that every rebuild can pull arbitrary
# new upstream commits.

# tini = tiny init that we run as PID 1. Without it, hermes's grandchild
# processes (MCP stdio servers, git, bun, browser daemons spawned by tools)
# reparent to PID 1 when their parents exit and pile up as zombies. After
# weeks of uptime that exhausts the kernel's PID table → "fork: cannot
# allocate memory" and the container dies. tini reaps zombies in the
# background and forwards SIGTERM/SIGINT to our entrypoint so Railway's
# stop signal still triggers our graceful shutdown. Standard container init
# (same as Docker's `--init` flag and Kubernetes' pause container).
#
# Node.js is required only at build time to compile the Hermes React dashboard.
# We strip the source + apt lists afterwards to keep the image lean.

# Install hermes-agent (provides the `hermes` CLI) and pre-build its React
# dashboard so `hermes dashboard` has nothing to build at runtime.
# Deleting web/ afterwards makes hermes's internal _build_web_ui skip the
# rebuild step (it early-returns when package.json is absent), so container
# startup is fast and no runtime npm dependency is needed.
# NOTE: We expand hermes-agent's `[all]` extra manually here, omitting `[mistral]`.
# Upstream's `[mistral]` pins `mistralai>=2.3.0,<3`, but the `mistralai` project on
# PyPI is currently quarantined (zero installable versions), which makes the full
# `[all]` extra unresolvable. Drop `[mistral]` from our expansion until either
# PyPI restores the package or upstream removes the pin.

# Why pre-build ui-tui (and why we don't delete it after):
# - The dashboard's embedded Chat tab spawns `node ui-tui/dist/entry.js`
#   on every WebSocket connect to /api/pty.
# - hermes's _make_tui_argv runs `npm install` + `npm run build` via
#   *synchronous* subprocess.run if dist/entry.js is missing or stale —
#   that would block the dashboard's asyncio event loop for 30-60s on
#   the first chat-open, freezing every other request.
# - Pre-building at image time costs ~200-300 MB of node_modules but
#   makes first-chat-open instant and surfaces any build failure here
#   instead of at user request time.
# - We keep ui-tui/ entirely (node_modules + dist + src) so hermes's
#   freshness checks don't trigger a re-install at runtime.

# always returns True, triggering a full `npm run build` inside every /chat WebSocket request. Setting HERMES_TUI_DIR routes through the
# early-return path in _make_tui_argv that skips staleness detection entirely. Upstream bug; remove this when v2026.5.x ships the fix.
